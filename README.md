## Installation:
1. Install TamperMonkey from your Browser's Add-on/Extension site
1. Visit https://shrekislovelife.github.io/kooba-helper/kooba-helper.user.js
1. Hit the Install button
1. Maybe give TamperMonkey permission for Incognito/Private browsing mode if you use that
1. To update, just visit the user.js page mentioned above and click the update button. (It also now uses the TamperMonkey built-in update.)



## Bookmarklet:
* This is not a recommended way to use this tool.
* If for some reason you don't want to install TamperMonkey, but still want some of the benefits of Kooba-Helper, it's available as a bookmarklet.
   * A bookmarklet is a link you can put in your bookmarks or bookmark bar that runs some code on a website when clicked.
   * Unfortunately, the bookmarklet will not run automatically, so you have to click it on every page view if you want to make use of it.
* You can get the bookmarklet at https://shrekislovelife.github.io/kooba-helper/bookmarklet.html by following the instructions on that page.
* The kooba-helper.user.js is the same source code as used in the bookmarklet.
  * You can regenerate the bookmarklet by pasting the code from the user.js in  https://shrekislovelife.github.io/audible-meta-bookmarklet/make_bookmarklet.html





## Native Extensions:
As of v2019.12.10.5
* I've dropped support for the Browser Exclusive Extensions/Add-ons
* Please Install TamperMonkey Extension/Add-on and then install Kooba-Helper by visiting https://shrekislovelife.github.io/kooba-helper/kooba-helper.user.js
* This is a cross-browser solution that works great for a tool like this.
* The last repository to have the code for Chrome and Firefox Extensions is: https://github.com/ShrekIsLoveLife/kooba-helper/tree/48ac583fa44b8d79fa4dc69be9f784151428a864
* Since the Bookmarklet shares the same code and structure as the TamperMonkey Script, I will keep it updated for now.
