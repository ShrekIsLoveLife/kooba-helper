## Changelog:
2019.12.10.2
* Only processes on Book and Test sections

2019.12.10.1
**Since v1.9.1**
* Changed version convention to YYYY.MM.DD.#
* Upon page load, it processes code boxes, now it detours the thank function and processes when thanked is clicked
  * This done at intervals from 200 ms to 10 sec to account for lag, but most should be processed on the first 200ms process, but I have a few extra buffer times
  * I have to inject the src into the site instead of running in the Extension sandbox to expose it to the forum's thank functions to perform a detour
   * I could avoid injecting and using addEventListener, dispatchEvent, and sendMessage, but why complicate it.
* The actual processing code is wrapped in a function as well, so it can be called
* When it injects the search links, it also tags the codeheader with a class so it does not process the same code section multiple times
* I also adjusted kooba-search-links to be class based instead of id based
  * There can be multiple thank/hide buttons on a single page
* I changed the refer hider to blankrefer because it doesn't show a delayed page while it wants to show an ad or do w/e
* I also added a few more replaces in the searches and used regexp
* The searches now use a keyword replace of {query}
* Searches for PostBot style hide/code boxes
* Standardizes code sanitization of search string
